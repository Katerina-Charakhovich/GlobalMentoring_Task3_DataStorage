# GlobalMentoring_Task3_File Sharing
## Implement the next use cases of File Share application:
1.	Save file to the database.
2.	Retrieve file from the database.
3.	Optional: file expiration.
Large files should be supported (size up to 200 MB).
Acceptance criteria:
1.	File Share database schema is developed: 
o	DB schema diagram is provided (5 points);
o	stored procedures for saving and retrieving files from DB are created (5 points).
2.	DAO on JDBC is implemented: 
o	DAO methods that are not used in proposed use cases can throw UnsupportedOperationException (2 points);
o	CallableStatement is used to call DB stored procedures (3 points);
o	large binary files are retrievable from DB (5 points).
Think about pros and cons of stored procedures usage comparing to SQL statement stored in Java code. Describe what difficulties youâ€™ve faced when working with large binary files. Make demo via console interface or via special main method.
